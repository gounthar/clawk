# clawk architecture

How clawk is put together, for contributors. For *using* clawk see the
[README](README.md); for the reasoning behind the subsystem designs see
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

clawk is a thin, short-lived CLI in front of a long-lived per-sandbox VM. The
CLI process exits as soon as your command finishes, so the VM can't live in
it — every sandbox is owned by a **detached daemon** the CLI spawns and then
talks to over sockets.

## How a command flows

`clawk up` (or the bare `clawk`):

1. The cobra command resolves the sandbox record and its provider, then calls
   `provider.Start`.
2. `Start` spawns a detached daemon — `__vzd` on macOS, `__fcd` on Linux
   (`setsid`, stdio detached) — that owns the VM for its whole lifetime, and
   waits for the in-guest agent to answer over vsock before returning.
3. The daemon builds a `machine.Spec` (CPUs, memory, the OCI rootfs disk, the
   network, a vsock device, the serial log), asks the `machine` library for
   the right backend, and boots the VM. It also brings up gvproxy and, on
   macOS, the agent proxy, the ssh-agent proxy, and the reverse-forward proxy.

`clawk` / `clawk run <runner>` then connect to the **in-guest pty-agent over
vsock** (AF_VSOCK port 1024). Each attach spawns a fresh child in the guest and
tears it down on disconnect — container-exec semantics, not a long-lived TTY.
There is no sshd in either provider.

On macOS the daemon also runs an **idle watchdog**: once the sandbox has had
no attached session and a quiescent guest (load and network counters from the
agent's vsock snapshot, port 1027) for its idle timeout, the daemon records
the park in the sandbox record (`stop_reason: idle`, `DesiredState`
untouched) and stops the VM to hand its memory back to the host. Any attach
or run verb boots it back; `internal/cli/idle.go` holds the decision logic.

## The guest stack

Sandboxes boot an OCI image as an ext4 rootfs with three small Go binaries
injected (`internal/agentembed`, cross-compiled on the host at build time):

- **clawk-init** — PID 1. Sets up `/dev`, networking, the workspace, and the
  guest user, then starts the services named in its config disk.
- **clawk-pty-agent** — listens on AF_VSOCK 1024, allocates a PTY per session,
  and speaks the framing in `internal/vsockproto` to the host
  (`internal/vsockclient`). This is the sole control path into the guest.
- **clawk-time-sync** — corrects guest clock skew after host sleep/wake.

## Networking

Both providers route the guest through an **in-process gvproxy**
(gvisor-tap-vsock) userspace TCP/IP stack acting as the guest's gateway, DHCP
server, DNS resolver, and NAT — no host root, no real bridge address. Egress
is filtered by `internal/netfilter.AllowList`, which gvproxy consults on every
outbound TCP SYN, UDP flow, ICMP echo, and DNS answer (a vendored gvproxy fork
adds the filter hooks). Two attachment modes, abstracted by `machine.UserMode`:

- **fd-NIC** (vz): Virtualization.framework's file-handle NIC speaks the same
  unixgram datagram protocol as gvproxy, so they attach directly.
- **TAP bridge** (firecracker): firecracker speaks only a host TAP, so the
  daemon runs gvproxy and a userspace **frame pump** shovels Ethernet frames
  between gvproxy's unixgram socket and the guest's TAP across an IP-less L2
  bridge (`machine/firecracker/usermode_linux.go`).

Port forwards go both ways, by two different mechanisms. Outbound
(`clawk forward add`) is a gvproxy binding on the host's loopback, fixed when
the VM starts. Inbound (`clawk forward add-reverse`) can't be: a guest process
dialling `127.0.0.1` reaches the guest's own loopback, with no route to the
host's. So the guest agent binds the port itself and tunnels each connection
over vsock to the daemon, which validates the requested port against the
sandbox's configured set before dialling the host service (`internal/revfwd`
for the protocol, `internal/cli/reverse_forward.go` for the host end). The
daemon pushes set changes down the same channel, so those edits apply to a
running guest. vz only — firecracker's vsock is one-way.

Serial ports (`clawk serial add`) ride the same asymmetry and reuse its whole
shape: the guest agent creates a PTY per configured device, and holding that
PTY open is what makes the agent dial the daemon, which validates the device
name against the configured set and opens the physical tty (`internal/
serialfwd` for the protocol, `internal/cli/serial_proxy.go` for the host end,
`internal/serialport` for the tty itself). Passing the USB device through
instead is not an option on either provider — Virtualization.framework
exposes no physical USB passthrough and firecracker has no USB bus — and it
isn't needed: the tooling wants a tty and a baud rate, not a USB endpoint.
Tying the host-side open to the guest-side open also reproduces the DTR edge
that resets an Arduino at the moment an upload expects it.

Live allow-list edits reach the running daemon over a control socket
(`internal/vzdctl`); when the sandbox is down they apply on the next `up`.
The same socket carries the VM lifecycle verbs: `clawk pause` / `resume`
freeze and continue the vCPUs in place, and `clawk snapshot` saves memory +
device state next to the VM and stops it — the next boot restores the guest
mid-thought instead of cold-booting (rendered as `paused` and
`stopped (suspended)` in `status`/`list`).

## The `machine` module

`machine/` is a **separate Go module** (`github.com/clawkwork/clawk/machine`)
wired in with a `replace` directive. It's a self-contained, hypervisor-neutral
VM library: a `Backend`/`Machine` interface, a declarative `Spec`, an OCI →
ext4 rootfs builder (`machine/oci`, `machine/internal/ext4`), the gvproxy
userspace stack (`machine/internal/usermode`), and reflink-based disk cloning
(`machine/internal/cow`). Backends register themselves at init; callers do
`machine.Get("vz"|"firecracker")`. It's held at arm's length from the CLI
because it pins a vendored `gvisor-tap-vsock` fork; everything clawk-specific
(guest manifest, shares, agent-socket conventions) stays in `internal/sandbox`.

## Package map

| Path | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `cmd/clawk` | Entry point; the single `os.Exit` site (unwraps `sandbox.ExitError`). |
| `internal/cli` | Cobra command tree, one file per verb. Provider construction is split per-OS (`providers_darwin.go` / `providers_linux.go`) so an unsupported provider fails at validation, not at runtime. The `__vzd` / `__fcd` daemons live here, sharing `daemon.go`. |
| `internal/sandbox` | The two providers (vz/firecracker) and clawk-specific guest setup: manifest, shares, OCI rootfs assembly, agent-socket conventions. |
| `internal/template` | `clawk.mod` lexer + parser (typed `sandbox` / `policy` / `namespace` blocks). |
| `internal/agentembed` | The in-guest binaries (clawk-init, pty-agent, time-sync), cross-compiled and injected into the rootfs. |
| `internal/vsockproto` / `internal/vsockclient` | The host↔guest vsock framing and the host-side client. |
| `internal/revfwd` | Reverse-forward wire protocol (host loopback services exposed on the guest's loopback), mirrored in the guest agent. |
| `internal/serialfwd` / `internal/serialport` | Serial-forwarding wire protocol (mirrored in the guest agent) and the host-side tty open/termios. |
| `internal/netfilter` | Egress allow-list (IPs/CIDRs/domains, DNS-aware) consumed by gvproxy. |
| `internal/vzdctl` | Daemon control socket (live policy edits, denial ledger, VM pause/resume/suspend). |
| `internal/worktree` / `internal/pr` | Multi-repo branch coordination and PR creation. |
| `internal/config` | The sandbox record store under `~/.clawk`. |
| `machine/` | The hypervisor-neutral VM library (separate module). |

## Providers

| | vz | firecracker |
|--|----|-------------|
| Host | macOS (Apple silicon) | Linux |
| Hypervisor | Virtualization.framework (cgo, Code-Hex/vz) | `firecracker` + `/dev/kvm` |
| NIC | file-handle NIC speaking gvproxy's datagram protocol | TAP, bridged to gvproxy by the frame pump |
| Network devices | none on the host | bridge + 2 TAPs, in a per-sandbox unprivileged user+netns (rootless, default) or on the host via sudo (fallback) |
| Worktree | virtio-fs live mount (`/home/agent/workspace`) | its own ext4 disk built in userspace, mounted at `/workspace`; host edits don't propagate |

The split is `//go:build`-gated and total: a Linux checkout can't compile the vz
code and vice versa. Most of clawk is shared; only the hypervisor glue is
platform-specific.
