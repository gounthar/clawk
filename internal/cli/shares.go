// collectSandboxShares enumerates every virtio-fs directory the sandbox wants
// mounted, as machine.Share entries for the vz backend. It MUST stay in
// lock-step with the guest mount manifest (sandbox.OCIGuestManifest): a tag
// present in one but not the other means the guest tries to mount a device vz
// never exposed, or vz exposes a device the guest never mounts.
//
// Worktree consolidation: every managed (non-in-place) worktree lives under a
// single host parent (store.WorktreeDir), so we expose that parent as ONE
// virtio-fs device tagged WorkspaceShareTag rather than one device per phase.
// Apple's Virtualization.framework caps the number of virtio/PCIe devices on
// a VM (see machine/vz); a sandbox with many repos used to blow past the
// ceiling and fail to start with an opaque internal error. Each worktree
// still appears at WorkspaceRoot/<repo> through this one device.
//
// In-place phases (from `clawk here`) point their worktree at the user's own
// repo, which lives OUTSIDE the worktree parent — so each keeps its own
// device, sub-mounted on top of the consolidated parent. They emit no
// src_<repo> alias: Repo == Worktree there, and exposing one host path under
// two virtiofs tags has bitten us with mount conflicts.
